# Ready-to-go: First exercise (small, self-contained — do this now)

Task name: Fetch & Render — Countries List

Goal: Build a tiny React + TypeScript component/app that fetches a list of countries from the REST Countries API and renders a searchable list.

## Requirements

[X] Use TypeScript.

[X] Use fetch to GET <https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all>. - Had to add in query params to limit fields.

[X] Render list of countries showing flag (emoji or image), name, region, and population.

[X] Add a search input that filters countries by name (debounced 300ms).

[X] Component must be accessible: search input has a label, images have alt text. - TODO: Might be done?

[X] Make component responsive (works on narrow/mobile screen).

[X] Add a small TypeScript type for the API response (you don't need to model every field — only the fields you use).

[ ] Provide run steps in README or in the submission block.

## Nice-to-have (not required for first pass)

[ ] Sort by population toggle (asc/desc).

[ ] Small skeleton loader while fetching.

## Acceptance criteria

[ ] App runs without console errors and shows the list.

[ ] Search filters correctly with debounce.

[ ] Types used for API response and component props.

[ ] Submit using the submission format above with relevant files or a GitHub link and commit hash.
